Step 1: Understand the Funnel Metrics
The funnel tracks two events:
"View Item Details": Users who viewed item details.
"Add to Cart": Users who added an item to their cart.
Conversion: The percentage of users who transitioned from "View Item Details" to "Add to Cart" within 1 day.
We need to calculate the conversion rate per city and identify the city with the highest conversion rate.
Step 2: Analyze the Timeframe and Events
Timeframe: June 2022.
Filter the dataset for:
Event names: "View Item Details" and "Add to Cart".
Users completing the transition within 1 day.
Step 3: Steps for Calculation
Filter the Dataset:
Select rows where event_name is either "View Item Details" or "Add to Cart".
Restrict the data to June 2022.
Group by City:
Group the data by city to calculate metrics for each city.
Match Events:
For each "View Item Details" event, check if the same user performed "Add to Cart" within 1 day.
Calculate Conversion Rate:
For each city:
Conversion Rate=(Users who completed the funnel Users who started the funnel)×100
Conversion Rate=( Users who started the funnel Users who completed the funnel )×100
Find the City with the Highest Conversion:
Identify the city with the maximum conversion rate.
Step 4: Using Amplitude for Funnel Analysis
Based on the provided chart:

Use the Funnel Analysis tool in Amplitude:
Define the funnel events: "View Item Details" → "Add to Cart".
Set the conversion window to 1 day.
Group by city.
Amplitude Output:
The chart will display conversion rates per city.
Identify the city with the highest conversion.
Step 5: Example Calculation
Assume the following data from Amplitude for June 2022:

City	View Item Details	Add to Cart	Conversion Rate (%)
Sydney	1,000	500	50%
Melbourne	800	400	50%
Brisbane	600	450	75%
Result:

Brisbane has the highest conversion rate of 75%.
